# Phonebook-App

This is a phonebook app that I have been working on as I have been learning React from a "FullStack Web Development" course from the University of Helesinki.
It is very basic but it is one of my first attempts of coding. Recently, I have been learning node.express to make custom api's. This is shown in the index.js 
folder.
